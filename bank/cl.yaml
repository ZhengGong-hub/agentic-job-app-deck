  text: "I like to imagine myself as a focused person, who likes very specific taste of works, and possesses a set of skills that help me to do those tasks well. I studied math and statistics when i realized that what I want to do is on the quantitative side of things. I quite enjoy numbers paint the picture of how societies grow, markets move, and people decide. As I grew, I saw the need of my knowledge expanding into coding and machine learning, as they are the best tools to translate chaos into pattern, and data into understanding. Every data person will inresistably find a domain to dive into, and finance and accounting are my niche: I am very interested in how they work together to create the economic system we live in. Therefore I extended my knowhow into these areas as well."

I bridge disciplines: I code like an engineer, reason like a statistician, think like an investor, and communicate like a teammate. I consider the GenAI tool as part of my toolbox, but not the only tool. It's a more intuitive, creative and versatile way of coding. It aids people in doing more with less, but does not replace them."

  text: "Ever since I was a child, numbers have been my way of seeing the world.
      While others saw cities, I read their GDPs, populations.
      I learned early that numbers are not cold; they are alive with meaning. They whisper how societies grow, how markets move, how people make decisions under hope and fear.
      
      Over time, that fascination matured into a belief — that within data lies a deeper truth about human behavior and collective destiny.
      To me, using tools like math, stats or coding is not just work; it is a craft of translating chaos into patterns, of turning statistics into understanding.
      
      My purpose is to use numbers not merely to measure, but to reveal:
      In the end, every model, every line of code, every dataset is part of the same pursuit: to make sense of a world written in numbers — and to understand it."
